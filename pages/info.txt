Equivalent Solver
Info

The equivalent value solver calculates the equivalent value of a resistor/capacitor/inductor network.

>> Resistors & Inductors
The equivalent value of resistors in series can be calculated by summing all the series resistor values together.
Req = R1 + R2 + ... + Rn

The equivalent value of resistors in parallel can be calculated by summing the inverse of all the parallel resistor values, and taking the inverse of the result.
1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn

Like resistors, equivalent inductor values are calculated the same way.
Series: Leq = L1 + L2 + ... + Ln
Parallel: 1/Leq = 1/L1 + 1/L2 + ... + 1/Ln
  

>> Capacitors
The equivalent value of capacitors in series can be calculated by summing the inverse of all the series capacitor values, and taking the inverse of the result.
1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... + 1/Cn

The equivalent value of capacitors in parallel can be calculated by summing all the parallel capacitor values together.
Ceq = C1 + C2 + ... + Cn


>> Calculator
The calculator operates by taking the input expression and using the shunting yard algorithm, parsing it into values and operators, generating a
Reverse Polish Notation expression, then obtaining the final result.

>> Operators
The operator for parallel combinations is the ascii pipe symbol, "|". Normally a double pipe would be used but a single pipe is used for simplicity.
Additionally the forward slash "/" can be used as well. For series connections the ascii plus "+" symbol is used.

>> Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
In Reverse Polish Notation, the operators follow their operands. This is also known as Postfix Notation. The notation does not need any parentheses for
as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. RPN is a stack-oriented method of calculating long expressions, so it was used in this calculator.

Component Combination Calculator
Info

>> Use Case for Combinations
When designing a circuit board, one may need to replace a resistor, capacitor, inductor to match a non-standard "arbitrary" value, 
or the non-standard value may be needed as part of the original design. The calculator can calculate combinations that are series only, parallel only, 
or both. In the case of a quick fix (bodge) of a resistor on a circuit board, one can use this calculator to find a parallel-only combination to achieve
a smaller resistance by stacking an additional chip resistor on top an existing one.

>> Calculator
Given the input and select options, the calculator brute-forces all possible combinations and returns the lowest-error results. Because of the nature of 
this calculator, the tolerance values do not exceed E24 (5%) as any component series above that will have standard velues fairly close to the target value.
By default the 3-component solution is disabled as it increases the compuation duration significantly.

>> Results
The results provided (in order) are one single-component solution, 4 two-component solutions, and (if enabled) 4 three-component solutions.




Closest Standard Value
Info

>> E-Series of Preferred Numbers
The E series is a system of preferred values derived for use in electronic components such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors.
These values were chosen such that when a component is manufactured it will end up in a range of roughly equally spaced values on a logarithmic scale.
Each E series subdivides each decade magnitude into steps of 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192 values.
Subdivisions of E3 to E192 ensure the maximum error will be divided in the order of 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%. The E192 series is also used for 
0.25% and 0.1% tolerance resistors.

Historically, the E series is split into two major groupings:
- E3, E6, E12, E24 are subsets of E24. Values in this group are rounded to 2 significant figures.
- E48, E96, E192 are subsets of E192. Values in this group are rounded to 3 significant figures.

Resistor Divider Ratio Calculator

(Rename index to R Divider Solver)

>> Resistor Divider
A voltage divider is a passive linear circuit that produces an output voltage (Vout) that is a fraction of its input voltage (Vin).
Voltage dividers are used to make signal level adjustments, for active device and amplifier bias, and for measuring voltages.
The formula and diagram for a voltage divider is below.
